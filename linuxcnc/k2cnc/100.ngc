( Set current Z position to 0 so that we will always be moving down )
G10 L20 P0 Z0

( Probe to Z-.5 at F1, this is meant to be slow!] )
G38.2 Z-.5 f1

( Set Z0 at point where probe triggers with offset of +1.47 [this is the thickness of my PCB plate. You must adjust this for your plate / setup] )
(G10 L20 P0 Z1.47)

(For now I'm going to set Z to the probed surface.  Once I have a standard plate I can use the thickness of that)
G10 L20 P0 Z0

( Rapid up to above the material )
G0 Z.5
